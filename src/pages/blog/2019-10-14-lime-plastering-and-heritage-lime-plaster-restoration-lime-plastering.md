Using lime render backing coats and lime putty finishing plasters over timber laths and masonry backgrounds allows the fabric of the building to breathe. Permeability and breathability is very important as it allows trapped moisture in masonry to permeate through the plaster and then can evaporate leading to a healthier environment inside the building and the buildings structure will not be defected.

Trapped moisture within old buildings or new builds are detrimental to the structure of the property and will allow the materials used to construct the building to breakdown, i.e. mortar, bricks, wood, cob blocks and adobe bricks will begin to rot away and will lead to big problems if left unresolved.



Lime plastering is great for new builds too as the lime will regulate condensation issues within the building.



The production of lime is great for the environment because during the manufacturing of lime the carbon footprint is greatly reduced compared  to the production of cement, and the carbonation of the lime plaster removes carbon elements from the atmosphere.



Lime plaster and lime render backing coats once fully cured have a much better expansion and contraction rate than modern plasters and cements which in return reduces cracks from forming when the structure of the building expands and contracts through summer and winter and the use of heating.
